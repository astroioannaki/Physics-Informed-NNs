# Physics-Informed-NNs

In this notebook we investigate different PINN implementations for harmonic oscillators, covering all three different settings: (1) the underdamped case with $`\delta < \omega_0`$, (2) the critically damped case with $\delta = \omega_0$ and (3) the overdamped case with $\delta > \omega_0$.
